LDJAM 31: Attack of The Yellow Cubes
====================================

This is my entry for LDJAM 31.  I started with the idea of saving
kitties and keeping bees out.  My naturalist friend thought this was a
terrible message and that I ought to seek support from Monsanto for
doing such a thing.  I thought about changing it from bees to wasps or
mosquitos.  But then I didn't want to do art, so there you have it.

I have boid swarming in this, they're attracted to you if you have the
door open.  They're repelled if you have the door closed.  On contact
with the door they die.  Kill them all and more waves will come.
